# Turtle Graphics

The implementation provided here utilizes the Python programming language and the `turtle` module, which offers a simple and intuitive way to create graphics and animations. With Turtle Graphics, users can draw shapes, create patterns, create games and build animations using a virtual turtle that moves around a graphical canvas.

## Installation

To use Turtle Graphics, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git or by downloading the ZIP file.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Sreeja799/Turtle_Graphics.git
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies. This implementation relies on the `turtle` module, which is included in the Python Standard Library.

   ```
   pip install turtle
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can run the Turtle Graphics application by executing the `turtle_graphics.py` file.

```bash
python turtle_graphics.py
```

This will launch a graphical window where you can see the turtle and interact with it using the provided commands.

The repository includes several example scripts (`examples/`) that demonstrate different functionalities of Turtle Graphics. You can explore these scripts to understand how to create shapes, draw patterns, and animate the turtle.
