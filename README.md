# Turtle Graphics

This is a Python program that utilizes the Turtle graphics module to create artistic designs and patterns. The Turtle graphics module provides an interactive drawing board where users can control a turtle that moves around and draws lines on the screen.

## Features

- Drawing basic shapes: The program allows users to draw various shapes such as squares, triangles, circles, and polygons.
- Creating patterns: Users can create intricate patterns by repeating shapes, rotating them, and changing their sizes.
- Customization: Users can customize the color, line thickness, and other properties of the turtle's pen to create visually appealing designs.
- Saving and loading: The program supports saving and loading drawings, allowing users to revisit their previous creations.

## Usage

To use the Turtle Graphics program, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository from [here](https://github.com/Sreeja799/Turtle_Graphics).

2. Install the required dependencies. You can use the following command to install the `turtle` module:

   ```
   pip install turtle
   ```

3. Run the `turtle_graphics.py` file using Python.

4. The program will open a new window displaying the drawing board and a turtle cursor.

5. Use the available commands to control the turtle and create your designs. Some common commands include:

   - `forward(distance)`: Moves the turtle forward by the specified distance.
   - `backward(distance)`: Moves the turtle backward by the specified distance.
   - `right(angle)`: Turns the turtle right by the specified angle in degrees.
   - `left(angle)`: Turns the turtle left by the specified angle in degrees.
   - `penup()`: Lifts the turtle's pen, so it does not draw while moving.
   - `pendown()`: Puts the turtle's pen down, so it starts drawing again.
   - `pensize(width)`: Sets the width of the turtle's pen.
   - `pencolor(color)`: Sets the color of the turtle's pen.
   - `fillcolor(color)`: Sets the fill color for shapes.
   - `begin_fill()`: Marks the start of a shape to be filled.
   - `end_fill()`: Marks the end of a shape to be filled.

6. Experiment with different commands and parameters to create your desired designs. You can refer to the documentation or tutorials on Turtle graphics for more advanced techniques.

7. To save your drawing, use the "Save" option in the program's menu. This will save the current state of the drawing, including the turtle's position and settings.

8. To load a saved drawing, use the "Load" option in the program's menu. This will restore the previously saved state, allowing you to continue working on your drawing.
